### 🗓 Handling Mixed Date Formats in Excel

While cleaning the `DOB` and `Hire Date` columns, the dataset had inconsistent formats like `02-11-1970` and `05/24/79`. Some were recognized as valid dates, others stored as text due to system locale differences.

**✅ Fix Applied:**  
Used Excel’s **Text to Columns** → selected **Date format → MDY**  
This converted all entries into consistent date format (`dd-mm-yyyy`) for accurate age and tenure calculations.

This step was **crucial** to avoid calculation errors and reflects real-world challenges in raw HR data.
